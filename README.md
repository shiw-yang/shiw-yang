# Hi! This is shiwyang!
**Welcome to my GitHub homepage!**

- 🏢 Currently, I am working at  [Horizon Robotics](https://cn.horizon.ai/) for more than 2 years.
- 💻 My expertise centers around back-end development, primarily with Go and Python, where I focus on an High-Performance Task Orchestration & Management System.
- 💻 Additionally, I extend my contributions to front-end development, specifically utilizing Vue, to craft intuitive and responsive user interfaces.
- 📚 You can find some of the technical articles I share regularly on [shiweiyang-Yuque](https://www.yuque.com/juduibenerjiasuanyierchunzhi-7tqem) and [shiwyang-Leetcode](https://leetcode.cn/u/sh1wyang/).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm not just a developer; I'm also an electric guitar player! Check out my [performance video](https://space.bilibili.com/34094578) to see me in action.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me via email at yshiwi@foxmail.com or by opening an issue in any of my repositories.
  
**Stay curious and keep coding!**
